# prog-contest-tool
A bash script to help practice competitive programming. When practicing problems I find myself spending way too much time creating a new project folder, adding all the necessary files, writing a makefile, etc. This project will:

* create a folder with a given name
* depending on the language given:
    * create a main.java file
    * create a main.py file
    * write a makefile and a main.cpp file
